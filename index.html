                            Individuals can increase fitness by increasing physical activity levels.[18] Increases in muscle size from resistance training are primarily determined by diet and testosterone.[19] This genetic variation in improvement from training is one of the key physiological differences between elite athletes and the larger population.[20][21] Studies have shown that exercising in middle age leads to better physical ability later in life.[22]
            
                           Early motor skills and development is also related to physical activity and performance later in life. Children who are more proficient with motor skills early on are more inclined to be physically active, and thus tend to perform well in sports and have better fitness levels. Early motor proficiency has a positive correlation to childhood physical activity and fitness levels, while less proficiency in motor skills results in a more sedentary lifestyle.[23]
            
                            A 2015 meta-analysis demonstrated that high-intensity interval training improved one's VO2 max more than lower intensity endurance training.[24]

                    <li>Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your arms extended by your sides.</li>
                    <li>Pushing through your feet and bracing your core, raise your bottom off the ground until your hips are fully extended, squeezing your glutes at the top.</li>
                    <li>Slowly return to the starting position and repeat.</li>

                            Squat to strengthen your legs and core, which will make everyday movements easier. Starting with a chair underneath you will help you master proper form.              <br> <strong>Directions</strong>

                            <ul>
                    <li>Stand in front of the chair with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly out.</li>
                    <li>Hinging at your hips and bending your knees, lower back and down until your bottom touches the chair, allowing your arms to extend out in front of you.</li>
                    <li>Push up through your heels and return to the starting position.</li>
